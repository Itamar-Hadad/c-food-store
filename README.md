# 🛒 C Food Store Management System

This repository contains a complete **multi-stage C programming project** simulating a food store management system.  
It was developed as part of the course **Introduction to Systems Programming (Course 10010)** during Semester A.

## 📚 Project Structure

| Part | Folder   | Description                                                                 |
|------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1️⃣  | [part1](https://github.com/Itamar-Hadad/c-food-store/tree/main/Part%201) | Basic store system with structs, dynamic memory, and menus              |
| 2️⃣  | [part2](https://github.com/Itamar-Hadad/c-food-store/tree/main/Part%202) | Linked lists, file I/O (text & binary), function pointers, polymorphism |
| 3️⃣  | [part3](https://github.com/Itamar-Hadad/c-food-store/tree/main/Part%203) | Compressed binary files, macros, variadic functions, inheritance-like logic |

## 🚀 Highlights

- 🧱 Modular structure using `.c/.h` files
- 🔄 Dynamic memory management with `malloc`, `realloc`, `free`
- 📁 File handling in text and binary formats
- 🧠 Use of `void*` and function pointers for generic and polymorphic design
- 🗜️ Bit-level compression of binary data
- 💬 Variadic function implementation
- 🧼 Defensive programming using macros
